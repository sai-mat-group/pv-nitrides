# Pnictide photovoltaics
This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all twenty pnictides considered as part of the research manuscript, that is available at DOI: https://link-to-be-updated.

The goal of the research project was to screen through the non-redox-active pnictide chemical space for identifying potential beyond-silicon photovoltaic materials.
