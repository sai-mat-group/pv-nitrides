# Pnictide photovoltaics
This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all twenty pnictides considered as part of the research manuscript, that is available on arXiv <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12458">here</a>. The manuscript is under review and we will update this README page with a DoI once it is published.

The goal of the research project was to screen through the non-redox-active pnictide chemical space for identifying potential beyond-silicon photovoltaic materials.

Each folder has key output files (and a few input files as well) from density functional theory calculations performed for a given compound. We performed structure relaxations, density of states (DOS), and/or defect calculations for each candidate.
