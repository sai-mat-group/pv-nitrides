# Pnictide photovoltaics
This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all twenty pnictides considered as part of the research manuscript, that is available on arXiv <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12458">here</a>. The manuscript has been accepted for a publication at <a href="https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/pccp/">Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics</a> and we will update this README page with a DoI once it is available.

The goal of the research project was to screen through the non-redox-active pnictide chemical space for identifying potential beyond-silicon photovoltaic materials.

Each folder has key output files (and a few input files as well) from density functional theory calculations performed for a given compound. We performed structure relaxations, density of states (DOS), band structure, phonon displacements, and/or defect calculations for each candidate.
