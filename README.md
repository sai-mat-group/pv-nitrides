# Pnictide photovoltaics
This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all twenty pnictides considered as part of the research manuscript that is published at <a href="https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/pccp/">Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics</a> with this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP04453F">DoI</a>. An older, pre-print version of the manuscript can be found on arXiv <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12458">here</a>.

The goal of the research project was to screen through the non-redox-active pnictide chemical space for identifying potential beyond-silicon photovoltaic materials.

Each folder has key output files (and a few input files as well) from density functional theory calculations performed for a given compound. We performed structure relaxations, density of states (DOS), band structure, phonon displacements, and/or defect calculations for each candidate.
